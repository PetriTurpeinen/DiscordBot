Discord bot planning
------------------------


Quiz bot
------------

Classes:
---------

- main.pyÂ´
- text_files.py (methods needed for reading/writing text files)
- discord_commands.py (commands for the bot)
- database.py (methods to handle database)

Variables:
----------
- list for the questions (split i.e "|" needed to seperate question & answer)
- variable for the correct answer (use split, compare to user input)
- variable for the question (use split)
- database variable: key: user_name, value: user_score



functions:
- bot asks questions (await message.channel.send)
- user starts quiz(!trivia on)
- user ends quiz(!trivia off)
- user answers to the questions (message.author.name needed to store user name)
- bot checks if the answer is correct( message.content.startswith)

storage:
- user information stored in repl database
- questions stored in text files

libraries needed:
- errno ( file exceptions)
- random (choosing random questions)
- from replit import db (replit database)
- os (to retrieve discord authentication key from enviroment variables)
- discord 

functions & commands needed:

Discord
-------
- client = discord.Client() (make instance of discord class)
- async def on_ready (test for bot admin to see the bot is up)
- async def_on on_message (for handling discord messages)
- message.content.startswith (checking user input)
- message.channel.send (for bot to send messages on discord)
- message.author.name (needed to store user name)
Database
--------
- db["key"] = "value" (storing keys/values in replit- database)
- value = db["key"] (getting keys/values from replit database)
- del db["key"] (deleting keys from replit database)
- keys = db.keys() (listing all keys from replit database for test purpose)
File storage
------------
- try & except structure around file processing
- s.open("file path", "at") (open file & set it to append to add questions in the end)
- s.close () (close file)
- s.readlines (read lines in file)
File errors:
------------
except Exception as exc:
    if exc.errno == errno.ENOENT:
        print("The file doesn't exist.")
    elif exc.errno == errno.EMFILE:
        print("You've opened too many files.")
    else:
        print("The error number is:", exc.errno)
